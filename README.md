# Pacman-AI
UC Berkeley AI Pac-Man project: http://ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview.html

The parts of the project that implemented are:

  - **Search**: implement depth-first, breadth-first, uniform cost, and A* search algorithms. These algorithms are used to solve navigation and traveling salesman problems in the Pacman world.
  - **Multi-Agent Search**: Classic Pacman is modeled as both an adversarial and a stochastic search problem. Implemented multiagent minimax and expectimax algorithms, as well as designing evaluation functions.
